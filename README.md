# Optimal policy for value-based decision-making

These codes generate the figures presented in the paper by Tajima, Drugowitsch & Pouget (2016) [1] and run some extended simulations.

They are based on a fork by [James Marshall](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/J.Marshall/james.html) of a fork of [Satohiro Tahima's original repository](https://github.com/satohirotajima/Optimal-policy-for-value-based-decision-making). Unfortunately, the version in the original repository didn't run out of the box. James extended the code and fixed some bugs. Thanks!

## Usage

`valueDecisionBoundaryRR.m` generates figures used in Figs. 3 or 6 in the paper.  You can switch the utility function assumed in the model by removing commented-out lines in the code.
